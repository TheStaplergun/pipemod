v0.16.60
----------------------------
--Fix for potential Attempt to concatenate field localised_name (a table value) error

v0.16.59
----------------------------
--Fix blueprint correction for one-to-two-perpendicular pipes
--Hid all icons for clamped pipes and extra pipes-to-ground included in mod from logistics and other menus
--Added temporary lock icon for clamped pipes to differentiate them.
--Fix missing sprite for one-to-one-reverse-pipe-right in normal or less resolution
--Overhauled Icons
--Efficiency and accuracy update for blueprint corrector
--Made clamped pipes have icons that match their unclamped version, but with a lock. Easier to determine what type of pipes you need
--Fixed plenty of icon pointers for entities

v0.16.58
----------------------------
--Temporary fix for Dectorio
--Permanent fix for Factorissimo

v0.16.57
----------------------------
--Added pipe clamping tool. Just press rotate (Default is R) on a pipe (any mod any pipe) and it will "clamp" it in it's current position. This allows you to build other pipes nearby without them connecting to it.
--Press R on a clamped pipe to unclamp it.
--Clamped pipes are able to be blueprinted. Note: when building on a clamped blueprint, single click the item or it will fast-replace it with a regular pipe. This is focused towards being more convenient for bots, as it's a blueprint anyways.
--Changed default one to two to be perpendicular
--Changed all fluid boxes to default size

v0.16.56
----------------------------
--Fixed game breaking bug

v0.16.55
----------------------------
--Backend and efficiency update. You will lose any correctable blueprint data, but just once.
--Fixed bug where if a user places a pipe on a blueprint ghost that gets corrected, the game crashes.

v0.16.54
----------------------------
--Fixed custom input bug

v0.16.53
----------------------------
--Fixed intermediate products to be gated behind technology properly.
--Fixed rotation problem on t3 pipes
--Fixed various other random stuff
--Added blueprint script! Now you can blueprint this stuff without worrying. You will get flying text notifications for each entity fixed, and a notification when all ghosts have been fixed.

v0.16.52
----------------------------
--I messed up the version number in the past. Derp. People can't pull updates properly.

--Added T3 pipes. Distance set to 33.
--Added varying technology icons to match tier

--Changed costs of research
---T1, 50 Red
---T2, 100 Red/Green
---T3, 200 Red/Green/Blue

--Added custom intermediate items to reduce pipespam, clear up inventory clutter, and make the mod less cheaty.
---Pipe Couplers. For all underground connections. Tiered.
----T1: 1 Iron Plate
----T2: 1 T1, 1 iron plate
----T3: 1 T2, 1 steel plate
---Swivel Joint. For all rotateable pipes to ground.
---Pipe Segments. Tiered. Unlocks with each tech. Proportionally costly.
----T1: 1 iron plate
----T2: 1 T1, 2 iron plate
----T3: 1 T2, 2 steel plate

--Changed pipes to "carry" more fluid. Testing on this one. May revert to regular pipe value.
---T1 stays at 100 units.
---T2 will be 150 units.
---T3 will be 200 units.

--Restructured build costs of all pipes to work with new items.
---All pipe entities in mod now cost 5 segments per leg, appropriate pipe couplers for each underground port, and a pipe for the surface. Underground pipes do not cost a pipe.
---Rotateable pipes-to-ground also cost 1 swivel joint

--Because of above changes, regular pipe to ground entities are no longer rotateable. You must build the custom one-to-one pipe.


v0.16.10
----------------------------
--Added proper tier icons.

v0.16.9
----------------------------
--Fixed icon in underground L entity.
--Added T2 pipes. Distance set to 22.
--Added second tier research. Requires red and green research (30 units).
--Rebalanced all costs. Every underground segment costs a pipe. Previous design was giving away free pipe lengths (1 pipe per leg underground)

v0.16.8
----------------------------
--Altered included 4-to-4 pipe to 11 underground depth to match other pipes in pack
--Due to multiple requests, and re-assessment of use of these items, flag replaced to "goes-to-quickbar" instead of "goes-to-main-inventory"
--Added a prototype of a function that overrides build behavior of the underground I extension. You cannot build them any closer than their maximum distance to each other. Do not attempt to build any closer if your inventory is full.

v0.16.7
----------------------------
--Fixed nil value bug on rotating pipes

v0.16.6 (Don't hate on my numbering scheme)
----------------------------
--Redid graphics to match hue of each tier of belts (Only tier 1 right now. Next update will have T2 and hopefully T3 pipes)
--Updated Ping utility to show pipes that don't have all possible neighbors in red

v0.16.51 [HOTFIX]
----------------------------
--Fixed a bug in the 4 way underground junction being 1 tile shorter than it was supposed to be. This could have broken factories if you fast-replaced a lesser count junction.
--Also reduced underground pipe junction costs by 10 pipes each, since you'll always be connecting it to at least one other pipe.

v0.16.5
----------------------------
--Added a hotkey that will ping and show currently connected underground pipes for 15 seconds nearby you. This only works with pipe-to-ground entities, and the pump in this mod as of right now. What this means is that the included regular pipe with underground ports will not populate on here yet.
--Made porthole covers slightly larger for increased visibility


v0.16.4
----------------------------
--Added low resolution graphics. Near impossible to make out arrows below "Normal" graphic setting.
--Added a regular pipe that has 4 underground ports. Again, due to the way the engine is built, it will not show underground connections when hovered over. They're there.
--Fixed low res graphic for pump. It's not dancing any more.
--Fixed Locale information for the groupname and such. No more "Missing key" error.


v0.16.3
----------------------------
--Changed version number to match game version with my subversion
--**REMOVED UNDERGROUND PUMP** Check your factory to make sure you replace them with the minipump
--Added mini underground pump
---Custom HR and low res graphics
---Requires 50% more power to pump the same amount of fluid
---Requires 50% less space to do this
---No fluid colors in animation yet
--Added grouping for mod pack
--Organized item recipes properly
--Restructured prototypes
--Redid icons to be more apparent
--Corrected issue with underground pipes not being selectable over ground resources
--Made mod compatible with multiple surfaces and multiple forces


v0.1.2 [HOTFIX]
----------------------------
--Fixed game crashing graphics reference bug
--Playtested underground pump


v0.1.1
----------------------------
--Added low res version of underground pipe covers
--Corrected loading bug with 0,0 collision box (Changed to collision mask water-tile)
--Renamed pack and technology (Will have to research)
--Changed "goes-to-quickbar" to "goes-to-main-inventory"
--Added "Underground Pump" entity which only interfaces with underground pipes. (ALPHA)
---Reduces need for Pipe-to-ground or pipes at the end of the pump when using over long distances.
---Cannot interface with standard pipes above ground.
---Doesn't have custom graphic.
---Looks odd when facing north/south.
---Does not show connections when placing the pump.
---You have to hover over an underground pipe to see the connection. (even then the underground sprite goes halfway through the pump's model)
---Haven't playtested this. Please give feedback on if it works or not.
--Made underground pipe rotation only available after research unlocked
--Removed placeholder graphics from file (Made mod download smaller)
