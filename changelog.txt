Version: 0.16.57
Date: ??????
  Features:
    - Added pipe clamping tool. Just press rotate (Default is R) on a pipe (any mod any pipe) and it will "clamp" it in it's current position. This allows you to build other pipes nearby without them connecting to it. Press R on a clamped pipe to unclamp it.
    - Clamped pipes are able to be blueprinted. Note: when building on a clamped blueprint, single click the item or it will fast-replace it with a regular pipe. This is focused towards being more convenient for bots, as it's a blueprint anyways.
  Changes:
    - Changed default one to two to be perpendicular
    - Changed all fluid boxes to default size
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: ??????

    - Added varying technology icons to match tier
    - Pipe Couplers. For all underground connections. Tiered.

  Changes:
    - Changed costs of research
    - T1, 50 Red
    - T2, 100 Red/Green
    - T3, 200 Red/Green/Blue
    - Changed pipes to "carry" more fluid. Testing on this one. May revert to regular pipe value.

    - T2 will be 150 units.
    - T3 will be 200 units.
    - Restructured build costs of all pipes to work with new items.

    - Rotateable pipes-to-ground also cost 1 swivel joint
    - Because of above changes, regular pipe to ground entities are no longer rotateable. You must build the custom one-to-one pipe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.16.8
Date: ??????
  Changes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
